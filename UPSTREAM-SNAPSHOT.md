> "I don't think I've typed like a line of code probably since December, basically, which is an extremely large change." — [Andrej Karpathy](https://fortune.com/2026/03/21/andrej-karpathy-openai-cofounder-ai-agents-coding-state-of-psychosis-openclaw/), No Priors podcast, March 2026

When I heard Karpathy say this, I wanted to find out how. How does one person ship like a team of twenty? Peter Steinberger built [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) — 247K GitHub stars — essentially solo with AI agents. The revolution is here. A single builder with the right tooling can move faster than a traditional team.

I'm [Garry Tan](https://x.com/garrytan), President & CEO of [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/). I've worked with thousands of startups — Coinbase, Instacart, Rippling — when they were one or two people in a garage. Before YC, I was one of the first eng/PM/designers at Palantir, cofounded Posterous (sold to Twitter), and built Bookface, YC's internal social network.

**gstack is my answer.** I've been building products for twenty years, and right now I'm shipping more products than I ever have. In the last 60 days: 3 production services, 40+ shipped features, part-time, while running YC full-time. On logical code change — not raw LOC, which AI inflates — my 2026 run rate is **~810× my 2013 pace** (11,417 vs 14 logical lines/day). Year-to-date (through April 18), 2026 has already produced **240× the entire 2013 year**. Measured across 40 public + private `garrytan/*` repos including Bookface, after excluding one demo repo. AI wrote most of it. The point isn't who typed it, it's what shipped.

> The LOC critics aren't wrong that raw line counts inflate with AI. They are wrong that normalized-for-inflation, I'm less productive. I'm more productive, by a lot. Full methodology, caveats, and reproduction script: **[On the LOC Controversy](docs/ON_THE_LOC_CONTROVERSY.md)**.

**2026 — 1,237 contributions and counting:**

![GitHub contributions 2026 — 1,237 contributions, massive acceleration in Jan-Mar](docs/images/github-2026.png)

**2013 — when I built Bookface at YC (772 contributions):**

![GitHub contributions 2013 — 772 contributions building Bookface at YC](docs/images/github-2013.png)

Same person. Different era. The difference is the tooling.

**gstack is how I do it.** It turns Claude Code into a virtual engineering team — a CEO who rethinks the product, an eng manager who locks architecture, a designer who catches AI slop, a reviewer who finds production bugs, a QA lead who opens a real browser, a security officer who runs OWASP + STRIDE audits, and a release engineer who ships the PR. Twenty-three specialists and eight power tools, all slash commands, all Markdown, all free, MIT license.

This is my open source software factory. I use it every day. I'm sharing it because these tools should be available to everyone.

Fork it. Improve it. Make it yours. And if you want to hate on free open source software — you're welcome to, but I'd rather you just try it first.

**Who this is for:**
- **Founders and CEOs** — especially technical ones who still want to ship
- **First-time Claude Code users** — structured roles instead of a blank prompt
- **Tech leads and staff engineers** — rigorous review, QA, and release automation on every PR

## Quick start

1. Install gstack (30 seconds — see below)
2. Run `/office-hours` — describe what you're building
3. Run `/plan-ceo-review` on any feature idea
4. Run `/review` on any branch with changes
5. Run `/qa` on your staging URL
6. Stop there. You'll know if this is for you.

## Install — 30 seconds

**Requirements:** [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Bun](https://bun.sh/) v1.0+, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Windows only)

### Step 1: Install on your machine

Open Claude Code and paste this. Claude does the rest.

> Install gstack: run **`git clone --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/garrytan/gstack.git ~/.claude/skills/gstack && cd ~/.claude/skills/gstack && ./setup`** then add a "gstack" section to CLAUDE.md that says to use the /browse skill from gstack for all web browsing, never use mcp\_\_claude-in-chrome\_\_\* tools, and lists the available skills: /office-hours, /plan-ceo-review, /plan-eng-review, /plan-design-review, /design-consultation, /design-shotgun, /design-html, /review, /ship, /land-and-deploy, /canary, /benchmark, /browse, /connect-chrome, /qa, /qa-only, /design-review, /setup-browser-cookies, /setup-deploy, /retro, /investigate, /document-release, /codex, /cso, /autoplan, /plan-devex-review, /devex-review, /careful, /freeze, /guard, /unfreeze, /gstack-upgrade, /learn. Then ask the user if they also want to add gstack to the current project so teammates get it.

### Step 2: Team mode — auto-update for shared repos (recommended)

From inside your repo, paste this. Switches you to team mode, bootstraps the repo so teammates get gstack automatically, and commits the change:

```bash
(cd ~/.claude/skills/gstack && ./setup --team) && ~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-team-init required && git add .claude/ CLAUDE.md && git commit -m "require gstack for AI-assisted work"
```

No vendored files in your repo, no version drift, no manual upgrades. Every Claude Code session starts with a fast auto-update check (throttled to once/hour, network-failure-safe, completely silent).

Swap `required` for `optional` if you'd rather nudge teammates than block them.

### OpenClaw

OpenClaw spawns Claude Code sessions via ACP, so every gstack skill just works
when Claude Code has gstack installed. Paste this to your OpenClaw agent:

> Install gstack: run `git clone --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/garrytan/gstack.git ~/.claude/skills/gstack && cd ~/.claude/skills/gstack && ./setup` to install gstack for Claude Code. Then add a "Coding Tasks" section to AGENTS.md that says: when spawning Claude Code sessions for coding work, tell the session to use gstack skills. Include these examples — security audit: "Load gstack. Run /cso", code review: "Load gstack. Run /review", QA test a URL: "Load gstack. Run /qa https://...", build a feature end-to-end: "Load gstack. Run /autoplan, implement the plan, then run /ship", plan before building: "Load gstack. Run /office-hours then /autoplan. Save the plan, don't implement."

**After setup, just talk to your OpenClaw agent naturally:**

| You say | What happens |
|---------|-------------|
| "Fix the typo in README" | Simple — Claude Code session, no gstack needed |
| "Run a security audit on this repo" | Spawns Claude Code with `Run /cso` |
| "Build me a notifications feature" | Spawns Claude Code with /autoplan → implement → /ship |
| "Help me plan the v2 API redesign" | Spawns Claude Code with /office-hours → /autoplan, saves plan |

See [docs/OPENCLAW.md](docs/OPENCLAW.md) for advanced dispatch routing and
the gstack-lite/gstack-full prompt templates.

### Native OpenClaw Skills (via ClawHub)

Four methodology skills that work directly in your OpenClaw agent, no Claude Code
session needed. Install from ClawHub:

```
clawhub install gstack-openclaw-office-hours gstack-openclaw-ceo-review gstack-openclaw-investigate gstack-openclaw-retro
```

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `gstack-openclaw-office-hours` | Product interrogation with 6 forcing questions |
| `gstack-openclaw-ceo-review` | Strategic challenge with 4 scope modes |
| `gstack-openclaw-investigate` | Root cause debugging methodology |
| `gstack-openclaw-retro` | Weekly engineering retrospective |

These are conversational skills. Your OpenClaw agent runs them directly via chat.

### Other AI Agents

gstack works on 10 AI coding agents, not just Claude. Setup auto-detects which
agents you have installed:

```bash
git clone --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/garrytan/gstack.git ~/gstack
cd ~/gstack && ./setup
```

Or target a specific agent with `./setup --host <name>`:

| Agent | Flag | Skills install to |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| OpenAI Codex CLI | `--host codex` | `~/.codex/skills/gstack-*/` |
| OpenCode | `--host opencode` | `~/.config/opencode/skills/gstack-*/` |
| Cursor | `--host cursor` | `~/.cursor/skills/gstack-*/` |
| Factory Droid | `--host factory` | `~/.factory/skills/gstack-*/` |
| Slate | `--host slate` | `~/.slate/skills/gstack-*/` |
```
